# star_wars
This repo is for a project in which I analyzed the star wars series data. I dig for insights on which of the movies was the most popular by gender and region. To do this I used the pandas library as well as matplotlib in python. 

I created plots to show views on each of the movie, which were then segmented by different categories.
